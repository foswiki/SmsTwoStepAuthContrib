%$INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS%

This contrib is used by Wiki administrators, and is not directly relevant to ordinary users.

It applies to installations using the Net::SMTP email method for Foswiki-originated e-mail, 
and does not apply to those installations using sendmail or another mail program to send mail.

Simply install this contrib to enable Foswiki email originated by Net::SMTP to use servers
that require NTLM (Microsoft Windows) authentication.

When the contrib has been installed, specify the Windows credentials in Configure under
{SMTP}Username and {SMTP}{Password}.  To specify a domain name, enter it in the Username
field as domain\username.  

Although not recommended and insecure, you can prefix the username with V1: (e.g. V1:domain\user
or V1:user) to requrest NTLMv1 authentication.
